# Python Finance calculator
## A financial calculator
### About the code:
This project was built with the goal of providing the user with a financial calculator.
The user may choose between calculating an investmentâ€™s value for x amount of years, or calculating their monthly bond repayment.
The code works very well and takes multiple user inputs and can have endless outcomes. I originally wrote this code with Python in visual studio code.
I have also made sure that the code is not case sensitive to ensure that there are no mistakes whilst running the code.
